# About
The tunnelopen is a script that lets you open resource URLs through an ssh tunnel, similarly to just using the open command.

The original version of this script was developed by Tom Fine. More information can be found at:

### Help
```
tunnelopen --help
```

### Installation
Download and place within your command line binary path; i.e. the /usr/local/bin folder. Be sure to make it an executable via:
```
chmod +x tunnelopen
```

### Roadmap
I hope to add support for SMB, and other features.
